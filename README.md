- My motivation:  To build a small quiz with a timer that tracks the user's grade
- Why I took this challenge: This challenge requires using a good amount of script to create a working app.
- What the challenge solved:  I learned how to manipulate a webpage with using JavaScript.

### What I learned:  

1. That getElementById links to an id in HTML.
2. That it's easier to code and cleaner if I divide the codes to sections: DEPENDENCIES, DATA, FUNCTIONS, USER INTERACTIONS, AND INITIALIZATION. 
3. That functions is difficult to understand, but once I grasp the concept, the code seem to flow better.
4. Event Handler when a button is clicked. 
5. That DOM is another beast of itself I need to do a lot more reading and experience.  
6. That return in function provides value.


## Code Description

The HTML and CSS in this code was prebuilt.  I made most of my updates and changes in the .js file.
