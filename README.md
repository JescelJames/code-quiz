# My Fourth Challenge: Create a timed Quiz using Web APIs. 

## Description



### This is my first Web API challenge: To create a time quiz



- Challenge Link: h

- My motivation:  To build a small quiz with a timer that tracks the user's grade
- Why I took this challenge: This challenge requires using a good amount of script to create a working app.
- What the challenge solved:  I learned how to manipulate a webpage with using JavaScript.

### What I learned:  

1. DEPENDENCIES, DATA, FUNCTIONS, USER INTERACTIONS, AND INITIALIZATION makes it really easy for me to organize the codes. 
2. function parameter can be an event handler that would cause it to execute the event.  
3. That Object is easy to manipulate once you understand it. 
4. That return in function provides value.
5. That I have to review the day's lesson every  night in order for me to understand better.


## Code Description

The HTML and CSS in this code was prebuilt.  I made most of my updates and changes in the .js file.
